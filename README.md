An analysis of US Commercial Aviation patterns in the year 2015. This project used BigQuery and Colab to conduct an EDA of the dataset consisting of flight details from the year 2015. Some interesting insights found were as follows:-

1. The occurrence of airport names as numbers for the month of October.
2. Flight delays being concentrated in the Summer and Winter months.

Additionally, we conducted some Boston specific analysis.

`Popular Destinations`: Bostonians frequently fly to New York, Philadelphia, DC, and Chicago. JetBlue dominates with more than twice the flights of the second most popular airline, American Airlines.

`Cancellation Issues`: Overall, airlines face more delayed flights than cancellations. However, Atlantic Southeast Airlines in particular has a relatively high cancellation percentage of 3.37% in Boston.

`Regional Trends`: Flights from the Southeast, Midwest, and California are more likely to be canceled, influenced by distance and latitude. Flying to Boston from a distant city increases the likelihood of delays or cancellations.

`Seasonal Variation`: Winter months see fewer flights, and February has the highest percentage of delayed and canceled flights. October stands out as a relatively good month with fewest delays.

`Time-of-Day Analysis`: Afternoons see more delayed flights in the Northeast, with Martha’s Vineyard, Newark, and New York having the highest delays. On the other hand, evenings experience longer delays for destinations in the Midwest, specifically the Summit County, Cincinnati, and Cleveland airports in Ohio.
